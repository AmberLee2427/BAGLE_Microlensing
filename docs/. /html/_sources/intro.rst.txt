BAGLE TUTORIAL
==============
To learn to use the model.py code and make microlensing events and obtain/graph various information such as the amplification of the event or the astrometric shift, we have created a `Jupyter Notebook tutorial <https://github.com/MovingUniverseLab/BAGLE_Microlensing/blob/main/BAGLE_TUTORIAL.ipynb>`_.

PSPL Model - No Parallax
--------------------------
The first step in the tutorial is to generate a PSPL model with no parallax and do the following:

* Get amplification of event
* Animate the microlensing event
* Plot the astrometric shift

PSPL Model - With parallax
---------------------------
The second step is to generate a PSPL model with parralax adding the *ra* (right ascention of lens) and *dec* (declination of lens).

-----------------------------------------------------
Now we will do perform tests with an image from a paper and graph the lens, source, and image positions in addition to graphing the shifts on the sky.

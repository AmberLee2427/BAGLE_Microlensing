BAGLE is a python package used to model gravitational microlensing
events both photometrically and astrometrically. Supported
microlensing models include:

* PSPL: point-source, point-lens with parallax
* PSBL: point-source, binary-lens
* FSPL: finite-source, point-lens (currently testing further)

All models support fitting data with single or multi-band photometry
only, astrometry only, or joint fitting of photometry and astrometry
(recommended).

BAGLE TUTORIAL
==============
To learn to use BAGLE models, make microlensing events, and make
photometric or astrometric plots, we have created a `Jupyter Notebook tutorial <https://github.com/MovingUniverseLab/BAGLE_Microlensing/blob/main/BAGLE_TUTORIAL.ipynb>`_.

PSPL Model - No Parallax
--------------------------
The first step in the tutorial is to generate a PSPL model with no parallax and do the following:

* Get amplification of event over time
* Plot the astrometric shift over time
* Animate the microlensing event

PSPL Model - With parallax
---------------------------
The second step is to generate a PSPL model with parallax adding the *ra* (right ascention of lens) and *dec* (declination of lens).

-----------------------------------------------------
Then a series of plots are made of the lens, source, and image
positions on the sky for a set of microlensing event parameters
previously published.
